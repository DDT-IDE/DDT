Most icons here were reused and/or modified from other Eclipse plugins licensed under EPL.

See: http://xantorohara.110mb.com/core-icons/Eclipse-16x16.html for example
 

The _unused/ folder contains icons that are currently unused, but are of interest,
and may be used in the future. 

Design principle for D icons:

Variables: small rectangle.
Functions (including constructor): diamond shape.
Types of varios sorts: circle shape.

Available color for attribute overlays:
gold,yellow,red
* its best these do not match the overall icon color of the underlying element.
 Note that primitves and namespaces never have attributes so there should not be a color clash here.

Before submitting an issue:

 * Make sure you are using the latest LANG_IDE_NAME version.
 * If the functionality is related to some external language tool (like an auto-completed daemon, gdb, etc.), also make sure to have an up-to-date version.
 * Check the Eclipse Error Log for errors, especially Java exceptions (see `Help/About/Installation Details/Configuration/Error Log`). 
 If you find any that seem relevant to the bug at hand, attach them.

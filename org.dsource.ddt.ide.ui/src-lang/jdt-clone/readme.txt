This source folder is for classes copied from the main IDE plugins: JDT, CDT and DLTK,
but whose code has little modifications.
Usually only warnings are fixed, and imports changed.

Classes here should not depend only on Eclipse and Lang code, nothing else.

All copied classes should document the version of the original plugin they were copied from.

With a full review and refactoring, a class from here might be migrated to the base/ source folder.

## Installation

#### Requirements: 
 * Eclipse 4.3 (Kepler) or later.
 * A **1.7** Java VM or later. Otherwise DDT will silently fail to start.
 * A [DUB](http://code.dlang.org/about) installation and at least one D compiler. GDB for debugging.

#### Instructions:
 1. Use your existing Eclipse, or download a new Eclipse package from http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/. 
  * For an Eclipse package without any other IDEs or extras (such a VCS tools), download the ["Platform Runtime Binary"](http://archive.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/drops4/R-4.4.1-201409250400/#PlatformRuntime). 
 1. Start Eclipse, go to `Help -> Install New Software...`
 1. Click the `Add...` button to add a new update site, enter the **http://ddt-ide.github.io/releases/** URL in the Location field, click OK.
 1. Select the recently added update site in the `Work with:` dropdown. Type `DDT` in the filter box. Now the DDT feature should appear below.
 1. Select the `DDT - D Development Tools` feature, and complete the wizard. 
  * DDT dependencies such as CDT and DLTK will automatically be added during installation.
 1. Restart Eclipse. After that take a look at the setup section in the [User Guide](UserGuide.md#user-guide).
  

#### Updating:
If you already have DDT installed, and want to update it to a newer release, click `Help -> Check for Updates...`.

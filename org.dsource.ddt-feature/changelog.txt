== DDT 0.9.1 ===
 * UI cleanup: "Interpreter Container" now named "D Standard Library"
 * Fixed issue #20: GDC incluce/d/*/ library location layout not recognized
 * Fixed issue #36: Editor/parser doesn't recognize new operator's nested class instantiation syntax. 
 * Updated UserGuide documentation: added info for debugging, Code Templates, Auto-Indent. Restructured sections and updated/removed old info.

== DDT 0.9.0 (2013-11-14) ==
 * Issue #13: Added integrated debugging support, using CDT's GDB debugger integration. Supports:
   * Stop/resume program execution. Listing program threads and stack frame contents. 
   * Setting breakpoints, watchpoints (breakpoint on data/variables), tracepoints. Breakpoint conditions.
   * Stack variables inspection view. Expression watch and view. Disassembly view.
   * Non-stop mode (for supported GBDs). Reverse debugging (for supported GDB targets).
   * Most of Eclipse CDT is now a requirement for DDT (for the debugging feature).
 * Fixed issue #19: NPE when opening editor with hyperlinks disabled
 * Fixed issue #17: Assertion failure with cast expression and invalid code in UnaryExpression
 * Changed D perspective icon.

== DDT 0.8.1 (2013-09-23) ==
 * Documentation: added entry in [UserGuide#Eclipse_basics] about Eclipse memory settings optimization.
 * Fixed: Code Completion module list in import declarations now shows the module's DDoc.
 * Implemented: Code Completion now resolves:
   * auto declarations (resolved to the type of the initializer).
   * global type properties (.init, .sizeof, .alignof, etc.)
   * integral properties (.min, .max), float properties(.infinity, .nan, etc.), object properties (.classinfo).
   * static/dynamic array properties (.ptr, .length, .dup, etc.).
   * the type of bool/char/integral/floating/string/array literals (not map array though).
   * parentheses expression.
   * this/super literal expressions.
   * cast expression.
   * new expression.
 * Cleanup: Code Completion now shows no results if invoked after a float token ending in a dot.
 * Fixed 0.7.0 regression: Code Completion now locates all identifiers in multi-identifier variable declaration and multi-identifier alias declaration.
 * Fixed issue #7: Error parsing interface function with contracts but no body.
 * Fixed issue #10: Compiler installation search in preferences page.
 * Fixed issue #9: Control-click opens up new editor everytime
 * Fixed 0.8.0 regression: missing icon for D application launch action/configuration.

== DDT 0.8.0 (2013-08-30) ==
 * Updated DDT to latest version of DLTK (version 5.0, from Eclipse Kepler).
 * Changed: In DDoc view, the text of undefined macros now remains unmodified, instead of being replaced by empty text.
   * Example: _{{{My $(NO_SUCH_MACRO undefined) macro}}}_ will render as _{{{My $(NO_SUCH_MACRO undefined) macro}}}_ instead of _{{{My  macro}}}_.
 * Added: In DDoc view, added predefined DDoc macro: _{{{D}}}_. Works the same as _{{{D_CODE}}}_.
 * Implemented: Code Completion now presents language primitive results (void, int, char, etc.).
 * Fixed unintended behavior regression in 0.7.0 where Code Completion would not show any results when invoked in certain type reference source contexts. Examples (♦ denotes location where CC would be invoked):
{{{
foo[♦]♦
foo[123]♦
foo!♦(♦)
const(foo)♦
}}} 
 * Improved Code Completion to work when invoked next or inside a keyword. Previously it worked on primitive type keywords only ({{{int}}}, {{{char}}}, etc. ). Examples:   
   {{{
char intro, intro2; in♦ // CC invoked here will offer 【intro, intro2】 as completions
class Foo { char intro } auto x = Foo.in♦ // CC invoked here will offer 【intro】 as completions
}}}
 * Fixed 0.7.0 regression bug in editor resolving functionality where a reference would not be found if the cursor was at the very end of the reference.
   * Affects: Open Definition, Open Definition hyperlinks, References search, DDoc view hovers.
 * Cleanup: new UI base icons for most D source elements. New icon for D search.
  * The new icon design is meant to better convey visual information for the semantics of the underlying element.
 * Added icon adornment for templated types.
 * Added icon adornments for {{{const,immutable}}} attributes in variables.
 * Fixed issue #8: Missing enum members in the outline view.
 * Fixed bug with implementation of issue #3: support Debian Linux DMD layout.
 * Cleanup: changed some of the dialog messages for the Open Definition operation to be more clear and concise.
 * Cleanup: restricted some editor functionality to named references only (Open Definition, Open Definition hyperlinks, DDoc view hovers).

== DDT 0.7.0 - "Midnight Riders" (2013-08-15) ==
 * Requirements changes: now requires minimum Java VM version 1.7 .
 * Implemented issue #2: Support parsing of latest D syntax (up to D language version 2.063).
   * Completely rewrote D parser, creating a new hand-written parser (IDE no longer depends on descent.compiler).

 * Fixed bug in D Appearance preference page: var and funtions showing up as Structs in preview.
 * Fixed a bug with selective imports presenting all module symbols, not just the selected ones.
 * Code completion icons now consistent with the rest of the IDE UI:
  * (previously some decorators for storage classes or protection attributes were missing, and JDT like icons where not supported in Code Completion popup)
 * The -v2 switch is no longer included in default GDC build response file.
 * Implemented issue #3 : support Debian Linux DMD layout
 * Fixed code completion NPE bug with function declarations with missing syntax.

 * Fixed several bugs with the D Search Page (incorrect or missing search matches). 
 * Fixed bug of incorrect default text shown in D Search Page when editor cursor/selection was on a symbol definition.
 * Labels for D elements in the outline and quick outline now show type (for variables) and return type (for functions).

== DDT 0.5.0 (2011-08-26) ==
 * Updated DDT to DTLK 3.0
 * Made icons of D source elements (classes, structs templates, etc.) consistent throughout the UI. 
   * (Previously DLTK views and some popups used simplified icons, and only CA and outline used more detailed icons.)

 * Fixed some shortcomings related to auto indent in lines that started with comments.
 * Resolved [http://code.google.com/a/eclipselabs.org/p/ddt/issues/detail?id=30 issue@ELabs #30], changed implementation of editor folding to a newer API:
   * Now the editor can fold non-DDoc comments as well (a previous limitation).
   * Now the editor can fold unittests and conditional declarations (debug/version).
   * Added folding preference page, can now configure the initial state (folded or not) of each folding group.
   * The folding groups/kinds are now: comments, DDoc comments, module header comments, aggregate types, functions, unittests, conditional declarations.

 * `is` and `!is` now correctly considered as keywords for the purposes of syntax highlighting.
   * `!in` is fully highlighted, instead of just `in`.
 * Fixed [http://code.google.com/a/eclipselabs.org/p/ddt/issues/detail?id=41 issue@ELabs #41] and some other related parsing bugs with qualified expressions (DotIdExp).
 * Fixed issue where syntax highlighting would break when typing inside a multi-line r"" string.
 
== DDT 0.4.2 (2011-04-29) ==
 * Fixed [http://code.google.com/a/eclipselabs.org/p/ddt/issues/detail?id=33 issue@ELabs #33], bug with spaces in projects names: made all variables in DMD response file resolve to quote escaped values.

 * Fixed limitation where problem hovers where not more prioritary than documentation hovers.
 * Fixed [http://code.google.com/a/eclipselabs.org/p/ddt/issues/detail?id=37 issue@ELabs #37]: F2 always brings up empty documentation hover.
 * Fixed [http://code.google.com/a/eclipselabs.org/p/ddt/issues/detail?id=38 issue@ELabs #38]: autocomplete crashing / very slow. (Content Assist takes very long to show up when many completion options are available)
 * Added support for editor code templates in Content Assist. 
 * Fixed bug in cast expression, where the cast type reference was ignored by the parser/semantic-engine; 
 * Fixed bug where DDoc comments where not associated with the corresponding symbol definition if that definition had protection, storage, linkage, or certain other kinds of attributes;
 * Implemented [http://code.google.com/a/eclipselabs.org/p/ddt/issues/detail?id=35 issue@ELabs #35]: format immutable keyword and @annotations.
    * Added (nothrow, pure, shared, immutable) keywords to syntax coloring
    * Added @annotations to syntax coloring (spaces after @ not supported, any identifier accepted)

 * Fixed minor Content Assist bug where completions would not appear when requested on certain syntax errors.

== DDT 0.4.1 (2011-03-04) ==
 * Fixed some parser bugs. (mostly relating to Template Instance references and source with invalid syntax)
 * Fixed [http://code.google.com/a/eclipselabs.org/p/ddt/issues/detail?id=25 issue@ELabs #25] and other source highlighting bugs (like nested comments being lexed as non-nested comments). 
   * Also added additional syntax highlighting options for WYSIWYG strings, delimited strings, and character literals.
 * Fixed a bug due to reuse of a single instance of the editor source-highlighting & folding parser. 
   * This bug may have been manifested in obscure, unknown, and/or hard to replicate ways.
 * Fixed [http://code.google.com/a/eclipselabs.org/p/ddt/issues/detail?id=17 issue@ELabs #17], [http://code.google.com/a/eclipselabs.org/p/ddt/issues/detail?id=18 issue@ELabs #18], [http://code.google.com/a/eclipselabs.org/p/ddt/issues/detail?id=20 issue@ELabs #20], all related to editor auto edits. Properly implemented:
   * Editor auto-edits (smart indenting/deindenting according to block structure), added "Typing" preference page.

== DDT 0.4.0 (2010-11-17) ==

 * Updated IDE to latest DLTK version (1.0M2), and also to Eclipse 3.4.
 * Minor builder changes. Added $DEEBUILDER.COMPILERPATH builder flag for compiler executable location.
 * Implemented initial DLTK Type Hierarchies implementation. Supertype hierarchy viewing should work ok, but subtype hierarchy is not, needs further work on part of DLTK. (Type Hierarchy View is available by pressing F4, Type Hierarchy Pop-up is available by pressing Ctrl-T).
 * Minor fixes to the search engine (searching for classes and functions should work better now, as well as Open-Type)
 * Added auto edit strategies: smarter indentation on enter presses, copy&paste, etc. There may still be some kinks.

 * Improved name lookup: statement blocks and enum bodies are now supported correctly (they don't see forward definitions anymore).
 * Improved Code completion: duplicates or occluded names are no longer presented.
 * Can now set, view, and remove Descent-compatible breakpoints in Mmrnmhrm's editor (these will work with Descent's debugger).
 * DDoc text and code completion hovers are now processed and presented as HTML instead of raw characters, thanks to Ary Mazana's Descent DDoc parser. ([http://svn.dsource.org/projects/descent/downloads/images/mmrnmhrm_html_ddoc_hover2.png pic])
 * Fixed some Neo AST bugs.
 * Minor builder changes (builder still work in progress).

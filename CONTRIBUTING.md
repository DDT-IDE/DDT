 and operating system and architecture.
 * Check the Eclipse Error Log for errors or Java exceptions (see 
 `"Help/About/Installation Details/Configuration/Error Log"`). 
 If you see any error entries that you think might be relevant to the issue, post them.
 * Optional: you might be asked to post/attach the Configuration Log: This can be found at `"Help/About/Installation Details/Configuration"`

This source folder is for classes copied from the main IDE plugins: JDT, CDT and DLTK,
but whose code has little modifications.

Usually only warnings are fixed, and imports changed. 

All copied classes should document the version of the original plugin they were copied from.

With a full review nad refactoring, a class from here might be migrated to the src-lang/ folder.
